      <description>The Speed You Need Given that it is just shy over a month since I got my OnePlus 6, I thought it was a good idea to do a review. Even better, around just 45 days after the release of Android Pie (9.0), OnePlus has joined Pixel (Google) and Essential Phone in receiving the release update to Android Pie, although in stages.
A little bit of background: the first ever phone I got was a matured iPhone 3Gs nearing its (then momentous) end of life with iOS 6.</description>
