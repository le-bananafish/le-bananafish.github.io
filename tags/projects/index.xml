      <description>Preamble Isn&amp;rsquo;t ironic when you&amp;rsquo;re busy, you yearn for free time, but when you have lots of free time, you&amp;rsquo;re bored out of your mind?
No, just me?
November Update So, you may have noticed that my last post was in July; before that, the last post was in April. I managed to write enough to scrape by for the first four months.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long year and I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten most things.</description>

      <description>The last post I made was in April.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to make an excuse; it&amp;rsquo;s a valid excuse. When May and June came around, so did all the assignments and coursework, and I was simply swamped by it all.
However, what&amp;rsquo;s not valid is using it not to work on my &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo;. They haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any progress in months (or years). For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;m going to stop pretending. Though ideas for New Horizons and Indigo are always brewing in my head, nothing&amp;rsquo;s happening.</description>

      <description>Creativity + a small announcement We are often told that &amp;ldquo;imitation is the best form of flattery&amp;rdquo; as a commandment to instead seek originality. However, our greatest works do not exist in a vacuum, they revisit and reinterpret existing ideas in subtle ways and inspire thought. Of course, counterfeits, piracy and copyright infringement are huge issues.
Voltaire (once) said, &amp;ldquo;Ainsi, presque tout est imitation&amp;hellip; Les esprits les plus originaux empruntent les uns des autres,&amp;rdquo; or artistically rendered:</description>

The city was filled endlessly with these streets. Wide-built, marked by a row of towering commercial buildings on each side, most of them dilapidated or on the verge of becoming heritage sites.</description>
