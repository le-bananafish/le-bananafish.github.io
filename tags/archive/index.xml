      <description>&lt;p&gt;First published on Genesis Planetary on 24 Jun 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;This is a work of fiction.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Names, characters, businesses, places, events and incidents are either the products of the author’s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The city was filled endlessly with these streets. Wide-built, marked by a row of towering commercial buildings on each side, most of them dilapidated or on the verge of becoming heritage sites. The pavements were rough and filled with potholes, not that anyone noticed. The ground levels of the buildings often contained small stores, most of them in the business of convenience stores, selling basic necessities. But some stores were dark, filled with rough, dark and questionable people. I didn’t want to find out what they sold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
