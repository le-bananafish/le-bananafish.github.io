    <p>Hi, It&rsquo;s me. Who the hell is this <em><strong>me</strong></em> person being referred to?</p>
<p>My name is Sebastian Lau.</p>
<p>I have completed a postgraduate BA(Hons) degree in Linguistics, and hold a BSc in Computer Science and a BA in Linguistics from the University of Auckland.</p>
<!-- I describe myself as a pessimist idealist &mdash; I hope for a bright future for humanity but I am sceptical about how we're tracking to get there. Nonetheless, I remain interested in technological advancements, social impact and creative endeavours. -->
<p>I built this site in part as something to put on the CV and in part as a platform for me to express my thoughts, something I rarely do so openly. As a forewarning, this means that posts may be stream of consciousness or may read as incoherent thoughts stitched together.</p>
<p>My interests include technology, gaming, keyboards, linguistics, reading, writing, and thinking. The posts here may cover my interests, life updates, site updates, and other topics.</p>
<p>I would like a <em>real</em> job doing something in technology and wouldn&rsquo;t mind also writing on the side, so hit me up below if anyone&rsquo;s interested.</p>
<!-- For a background on my technical knowledge, I have some experience in the following programming languages: C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, C#, and Web basics (HTML, CSS, JS). I also have some knowledge of the static site generators Jekyll and Hugo. Hugo is currently used to build this site. -->
