      <description>Goodbye, oh teeth of wisdom! So.., I had my wisdom teeth extracted. They caused more trouble than they were worth. One was growing into the tooth next to it whilst another failed to erupt and was stuck under the gum. My teeth were biting into the gums.
The biggest irony is that the tooth that should&amp;rsquo;ve caused trouble was perfectly fine and the one that should&amp;rsquo;ve been fine was causing infections and swelling.</description>
