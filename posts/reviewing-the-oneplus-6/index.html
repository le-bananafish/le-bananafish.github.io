<h1 id="the-speed-you-need">The Speed You Need</h1>

<p>Given that it is just shy over a month since I got my OnePlus 6, I thought it was a good idea to do a review. Even better, around just 45 days after the release of Android Pie (9.0), OnePlus has joined Pixel (Google) and Essential Phone in receiving the release update to Android Pie, although <em>in stages</em>.</p>

<p>A little bit of background: the first ever phone I got was a matured iPhone 3Gs nearing its (then momentous) end of life with iOS 6. I stuck with it for a while but then switched to a Nexus 5, then the phone of my dreams, when it was 1 year old. Then the Nexus 5 was nearing its end of life and when it did, I rooted, unlocked and installed CyanogenRom which because Cyanogen OS and is now Lineage OS.</p>

<p>Then, the Nexus 5 started having issues and my dad switched phones (he originally got the N5 on my recommendation) and so I bounced between the 2 Nexus 5&rsquo;s and a Samsung S5 which my grandpa no longer wanted. Frustrated that there were so many issues with the Nexus 5 as well as the Samsung S5, I finally bought a OnePlus 6, an interesting thought since I nearly bought the OnePlus One instead of the Nexus 5.</p>

<p>Whilst I can say that my time spent using the Nexus 5 on stock Android was delicious, the OnePlus 6 has a <strong>juiciness</strong> and <strong>butteriness</strong> far exceeding that. After I ordered this phone, I devoured video upon video reviewing the phone <em>purely because they kept appearing on my YouTube feed</em> and every reviewer who reviewed the phone attested to its buttery nature. Even months after, their devices were performing excellently. This concludes my review of the phone itself.</p>

<h2 id="review-of-android-pie-9-0-oxygen-os-9-0">Review of Android Pie (9.0) &amp; Oxygen OS (9.0)</h2>

<p>Preface:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Oxygen OS</code> is OnePlus&rsquo; variant of Android. It is more than a user interface skin and generally contains useful features over excess features.</li>
<li><code>Android Pie (9.0)</code> is the latest release of Android.</li>
<li>OnePlus is among the earliest to release the update, behind Google and Essential.</li>
<li>Google develops Android.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the things that confused me was when I saw the version number for the update and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was. Turns out that from now on OnePlus is going to follow the Android version scheme and so the latest release is also Oxygen OS 9.0.</p>

<p>About a month ago, OnePlus released a forum post detailing their UI redesign. On the post <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/how-we-designed-the-new-ui-of-oxygenos.889458/">here</a>, OnePlus detailed how one of their design principles for the new user interface is <em>reductionism</em> with this very thin description:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By reductionism we mean the fundamentals of good design, aka natural rather than cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This thin wafer of a description is meaningless because what composes &ldquo;good design&rdquo; or what is considered &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is very much subjective.</p>

<p>Google is currently in the midst of a complete redesign of their Material design language and like OnePlus, they seem to be adopting this &ldquo;reductionism&rdquo; as evident with the recent redesigns of the YouTube, Photos, Messages and Chrome apps (on Android, not sure about iOS). <em>One of the gripes with this redesign is this reductionism</em>.</p>

<p>I consider reductionism and minimalism two different concepts. The following are my definitions and my own opinions.</p>

<p>Minimalism</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Minimalism: a focus on highlighting content rather than focusing on visual appeal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reductionism</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reductionism: a focus on reducing the complexity of visual constructs and the presentation of content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this redesign, both the general redesign and OnePlus&rsquo; redesign, there is a reductionism of constructs that aren&rsquo;t really universal and aren&rsquo;t really generic enough to understand. One example of reductionism is in OnePlus&rsquo; Shelf feature. Before Android Pie, The Shelf used Material design&rsquo;s previous metaphor of Cards on a transparent background providing a visual separation that indicated where the focus was. Sure, your chosen background was probably really pretty, but when it came to doing what you wanted, you could see where the actions you wanted to take were distinct from the background.</p>

<p>The issue with this <em>reductionism</em> is that it fails to take into account (something software companies are known for) what users actually understand as visual metaphors. The human eye <em>is</em> capable of distinguishing between similar objects but the processing required can be taxing on the user and disrupts their purpose in using the product.</p>

<p>An example of <em>reductionism</em> in OnePlus&rsquo; Oxygen OS is the Shelf. <!-- The headlining picture [here](https://www.androidcentral.com/how-customize-shelf-oxygenos) is an example of what the Shelf looked like with the Cards metaphor that Google previously adopted with Material design. Here is a picture of the updated version: --></p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><img src="/images/oneplus6/Screenshot_20180907-134147.jpg" alt="Shelf on Oxygen OS (5.1.11)" /></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><img src="/images/oneplus6/Screenshot_20180927-143731.jpg" alt="Shelf on Oxygen OS (9.0)" /></p>

<p>The difference between these two images is that before the update, there was a clear visual separation between each card and also from the background. This provides the user with clear indication where their content or the actions they wish to undertake are. After the update, there is still separation however the &ldquo;cards&rdquo; and the background are now the same colour and the only separation is the small gaps between each of the cards. It&rsquo;s not just annoyingly monotonous, it&rsquo;s also incredibly confusing as to where each card starts and ends.</p>

<!--
    possibly insert a photo of dark mode here!
-->

<p>Interestingly, the dark variant (I didn&rsquo;t try it before updating) is much better than the light variant but this highlights one of the disjuncts in the new design language. The light theme is overly bright and the dark theme is quite dark. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m also getting quite sick of writing this user interface critique so I&rsquo;d like to say thank you for reading and I&rsquo;ll now bid you goodbye.</p>
