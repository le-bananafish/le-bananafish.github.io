      <description>In the middle of January 2021 with nothing else to do, I made myself a New Years resolution. I vowed to write &amp;ldquo;once a week, or at the bare minimum, once a month&amp;rdquo;. I had a good run for three weeks in which I wrote a post roughly once a week. Then February hit, I procrastinated even more and the realisation that uni was looming sapped my willpower. So I amended my resolution to &amp;ldquo;once a fortnight&amp;rdquo; and wrote a single post in the entire month of February.</description>

      <description>Secret Hidden Level 1 Header This is my first post. Enjoy!
Part 1: Joke&amp;rsquo;s on you Joke&amp;rsquo;s on you, this isn&amp;rsquo;t my first rodeo with static site generators and as an experienced beginner level experimenter, I have a few complaints about static site generators.
I mean, why not have your first post be a complaint?
First, some history.
So, at one point in time at some point in time last year (2017) or so, I read somewhere that it was a great idea to showcase yourself by having a personal website as like a part-CV part experience point of reference.</description>
