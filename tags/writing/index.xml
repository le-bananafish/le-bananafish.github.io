      <description>In the middle of January 2021 with nothing else to do, I made myself a New Years resolution. I vowed to write &amp;ldquo;once a week, or at the bare minimum, once a month&amp;rdquo;. I had a good run for three weeks in which I wrote a post roughly once a week. Then February hit, I procrastinated even more and the realisation that uni was looming sapped my willpower. So I amended my resolution to &amp;ldquo;once a fortnight&amp;rdquo; and wrote a single post in the entire month of February.</description>

      <description>Creativity + a small announcement We are often told that &amp;ldquo;imitation is the best form of flattery&amp;rdquo; as a commandment to instead seek originality. However, our greatest works do not exist in a vacuum, they revisit and reinterpret existing ideas in subtle ways and inspire thought. Of course, counterfeits, piracy and copyright infringement are huge issues.
Voltaire (once) said, &amp;ldquo;Ainsi, presque tout est imitation&amp;hellip; Les esprits les plus originaux empruntent les uns des autres,&amp;rdquo; or artistically rendered:</description>

      <description>New Horizons New Horizons is a multi-era worldbuilding project extrapolated from pertinent events in the current state of world affairs. It encompasses multiple genres and takes inspiration from notable books, media and video games like Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Star Wars, Star Trek and Destiny.
New Horizons starts off with the events of the Third World War, the culmination of two centuries of political irresolution. It resulted in a drastic shift in global power, immense loss of life and massive ecological disaster.</description>
