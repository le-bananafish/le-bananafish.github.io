        <p>Hi, it’s been a while.</p>
<p>If I’m being honest, last year wasn’t great but it wasn’t terrible either. I was burnt out and I needed a break<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.<!-- Was a whole year necessary?  --> Did it need a whole year? Who knows but that’s what happened. I won’t make any excuses but I will make an announcement.</p>
<p>T<!--If we’re being honest, the quality of my work is probably mediocre at best, but t-->he perfectionist and supposed high achiever in me feels the compulsion for my work to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; and polished before I deign to share it, and as such I have either not even started or ever finished writing any stories in a veritable number of years.<!-- I have finished writing no story nor shared anything new in a veritable number of years. --></p>
<p>This announcement is to say that I intend to share <em>more</em> work in progress and in future there will hopefully be a history of the progression of my stories from snippets and drafts into something more polished.</p>
<!-- . If things go to plan, you’ll get to see the progression of my stories as they turn from drafts into something more polished. -->

<h2 id="whats-up" class="anchor-link"><a href="#whats-up">What’s up?<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>I have been playing definitely way too much <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> recently; one might even say it’s been a fixation<!--hyper-obsession-->. If I’m being honest, I didn’t think I would enjoy the game so much, given I usually hate turn-based combat, don&rsquo;t go for high fantasy, and other role-playing games have let me down in the past (looking at you <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>). My enjoyment has actually inspired me to revisit one of my projects and has inspired a new story based on what I currently know of and speculate about the plot of BG3 (no spoilers, please).<!-- Uncharacteristically, I am *actively* working out the plot of said story. --></p>
<p>Last year Clairo’s <em>Charm</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> kept me sane and Wallice and Pom Pom Squad’s new albums<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> were such great bops to close out the year with but I have recently discovered The Marias; why didn&rsquo;t anyone tell me about them sooner? At first, I actually listened to <em>CINEMA</em> on repeat, instead of their latest album <em>Submarine</em>, but both albums give me <!--cinematic vibes similar to -->Telenova<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> vibes, who describe their music as “cinema for the ears.” Maria&rsquo;s voice is <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>I watched a lot of movies last year and they were kind of a mixed bag. My favourite was <em>Humanist Vampire Seeking Consenting Suicidal Person</em>, in part because it was presented in québécoise, and the worst were <em>Longlegs</em> and <em>Megalopolis</em>, though I will respect Francis Ford Coppola for sticking to his vision and financing it himself when no one else would. So far, this year I&rsquo;ve watched <em>Nosferatu</em> which was &ldquo;ummm, okay&rdquo; and <em>Anora</em> which was interesting.</p>

<h2 id="site-updates" class="anchor-link"><a href="#site-updates">Site updates<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>One excuse I used to not post anything to this site is the fact that I wanted to time certain site updates and changes to certain posts so that I could immediately leverage the new features. Unfortunately this just meant I procrastinated actually writing the posts and then because I couldn’t find the capacity to make the updates I accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>The plan going ahead is to do something considered good practice that I should&rsquo;ve done anyways. Effectively, I&rsquo;m going to work on posts and site updates separately and separate development (post drafts, ui &amp; code changes) from production (the live site). In theory<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, there will no longer be the bottleneck described above and there will be more &ldquo;content&rdquo; on a more frequent basis.</p>

<h2 id="in-closing" class="anchor-link"><a href="#in-closing">In closing<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h2>
<p>Though I suspect I no longer have an audience, I&rsquo;m grateful I ever had an audience at all. I was surprised there were actual visitors to the site beyond me.</p>
<p>As always thank you for reading and see you next time.</p>
<p>P.S. shit, it’s kinda embarrassing that the last time I published a post was also March, of last year…</p>
