<p>There are so many things that <em>I was gonna write</em>. But I got lazy <strong>and</strong> I got annoyed at how little I understand how Hugo, the software I use to generate this site, works. I would love to be able to create Table(s) of Contents, or add templates for things like signatures, or dynamically alter the font of the theme, but <u>I don&rsquo;t know how to do any of that</u>.</p>
<p>Frankly, there have been so many changes to Hugo since I started using it that I don&rsquo;t really understand how it works. I&rsquo;m not sure what order of priority it treats the templates I create versus the templates bundled with the theme I&rsquo;m using. The things I&rsquo;ve accomplished only include how to overwrite the footer, how to create a questionably-SEO-friendly Error 404 page, and how to add posts to the site.</p>
<p>My <sup>tiny, [1]</sup> to do list thus includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>finish rewriting uni assignments in Rust (a programming language) <sup>for fun, and for the resume</sup></li>
<li>learn how to use Hugo <em>properly</em> (easy enough, right?)</li>
<li>learn ARM, x86, and RISC-V assembly language</li>
<li>learn how UEFI works</li>
<li>fix the stupid &ldquo;spaces in username&rdquo; path issue <sup>that I&rsquo;m partially using as an excuse not to learn the stuff I should for REDACTED</sup></li>
</ul>
<p><sup>[1]: also I should put some of these things on my resume to show that I have some experience, and hey, <i>maybe learning things is kinda useful as well?</i></sup></p>
<p>So, uh... what <em>was</em> I going to write about?</p>
<p>Well, lined up, I&rsquo;ve got:</p>
<ul>
<li>A post on my projects and what they&rsquo;re about (some are programming, most aren&rsquo;t)</li>
<li>A post on <em>Zach Snyder&rsquo;s Justice League (2021)</em>, aka &ldquo;Snyder&rsquo;s Cut&rdquo;, which <strong>you should definitely watch.</strong></li>
<li>A post on my thoughts on writing and my writing style</li>
<li>A rewritten version of my story <em>Social Justice</em></li>
<li>and another story, <em>The Empress</em>, in fragmentary form</li>
</ul>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t done any of it, because whenever I sit down at my laptop it&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m tired and I go to bed instead. Some things are complete, but it&rsquo;s obvious they are drafts and not complete works, others have nowhere near begun.</p>
<p>This will be sweet and short because like the rest of my most recent posts, it is mainly a placeholder. For when I get my s* together and actually do the work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I am often vague and cryptic on the true nature of my projects, I thought I should write up a post detailing what projects I am &ldquo;working on&rdquo; and what they are about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a quote out of that post I was going to write. I&rsquo;ll give you a little elaboration for clarity&rsquo;s sake since we (you and I) don&rsquo;t know when you&rsquo;ll get the full thing. There are three major projects that I care about, one of which is indefinitely postponed. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Horizons</li>
<li>Yellow Indium</li>
<li>REDACTED</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Horizons</strong> is meant to be a warning about how screwed up the world is socially and politically. But there&rsquo;s other aspects to it, like how I wanted to present a scientifically-grounded magic, to question how we define our identity, and to take inspiration from pop culture icons like <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, and video games like <em>Destiny</em>. Minimally, I have a couple of short stories, the first words of my novel, and a plan for the rest of the universe. Yay, a mess!</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Indium</strong> is the newest and freshest project. I began it during the last annual break due in part to nostalgia and fresh inspiration. Thematically it is an umbrella that allows me to tie-in various other projects. In the real world, it&rsquo;s meant to be a collectible card game like <em>Hearthstone</em>. However, I&rsquo;m not sure whether Yellow Indium should be a card game, an umbrella, or both. Right now, I&rsquo;m working on one of its &ldquo;child&rdquo; projects (INDIGO) and postponing the game aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Project REDACTED</strong> is meant to be an operating system. Yes, like Windows, macOS and Android. It is <u>indefinitely postponed</u> due to the fact that I have no knowledge of how to build an operating system, I don&rsquo;t really enjoy programming, and that I only have a conceptual of how its components are meant to work together.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>though I may never complete <em>REDACTED</em>, it will always be important to me [as it was the reason I decided to study computer science].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on such a sentimental note, I wish you good tidings and as always, thanks for reading!</p>
