      <description>In the middle of January 2021 with nothing else to do, I made myself a New Years resolution. I vowed to write &amp;ldquo;once a week, or at the bare minimum, once a month&amp;rdquo;. I had a good run for three weeks in which I wrote a post roughly once a week. Then February hit, I procrastinated even more and the realisation that uni was looming sapped my willpower. So I amended my resolution to &amp;ldquo;once a fortnight&amp;rdquo; and wrote a single post in the entire month of February.</description>

      <description>Goodbye, oh teeth of wisdom! So.., I had my wisdom teeth extracted. They caused more trouble than they were worth. One was growing into the tooth next to it whilst another failed to erupt and was stuck under the gum. My teeth were biting into the gums.
The biggest irony is that the tooth that should&amp;rsquo;ve caused trouble was perfectly fine and the one that should&amp;rsquo;ve been fine was causing infections and swelling.</description>
