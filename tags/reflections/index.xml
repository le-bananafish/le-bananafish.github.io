      <description>Twenty twenty-three will be the year I stop putting too much pressure on myself.
2023 is the year that I will do the things that I want to do in life.
Last year was a year of great change and paralysis. It was the year in which I finished my undergraduate degree(s) and the question of what I truly wanted to do in the future stared me straight in the face.</description>

      <description>reflektioner (sv) I&amp;rsquo;m going to make a bold and untenable claim â€” I&amp;rsquo;m starting a series of reflections on various topics, ranging from stuff in my personal life to contemplation on the state of my various projects.
There&amp;rsquo;ll be no set release schedule; I think by now we all know I can&amp;rsquo;t stick to one. I&amp;rsquo;m making this series because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it a lot recently (in my head) : I&amp;rsquo;ve finished uni (I finally got a (casual) job) and I have no clue what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in life.</description>

      <description>Preamble Isn&amp;rsquo;t ironic when you&amp;rsquo;re busy, you yearn for free time, but when you have lots of free time, you&amp;rsquo;re bored out of your mind?
No, just me?
November Update So, you may have noticed that my last post was in July; before that, the last post was in April. I managed to write enough to scrape by for the first four months.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a long year and I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten most things.</description>
