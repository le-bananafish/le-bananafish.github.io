      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Project Indigo: Faith&amp;rsquo;s Call&lt;br&gt;&#xA;1. Eliana&amp;rsquo;s Dissent&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Version last modified 29 December 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eliana woke to the weighted chains. She rolled onto her side, back to the wall, and propped herself up. The jailer jingled up and down the corridor. Eliana yawned and as she closed her eyes, she reached out and felt for them — nothing. A shame. The door rocked under heavy knocking. Eliana stood up. The dress of a Cardinal was unmistakable. As he entered with the imperium of the Faith, the smell of myrrh filled the air. The jailer kissed his signet ring. His attendants recited scripture as they followed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;creativity--a-small-announcement&#34; class=&#34;anchor-link&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#creativity--a-small-announcement&#34;&gt;Creativity + a small announcement&lt;span class=&#34;pilcrow&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;¶&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- I was going to tell you about my new project but decided it was better to talk about why I&#39;ve taken a hiatus from so many of my projects. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- It is said often that &#34;imitation is the best form of flattery&#34; however the full quote is &#34;imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness&#34; (Oscar Wilde supposedly). We often use this quote as a criticism or negative remark when there really is no black and white morality here. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- The largest problem with imitation is of course forgery, plagiarism and copyright infringement. By imitating, we are stealing the work of others and, even if not intentionally, pretend it is our own. And by and large, profiting from forgery, plagiarism and copyright infringement is a big industry that generates a lot of profit at the expense of its actual creators. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- The largest problem with imitation is of course that some people pretend the work is their own and try to profit off of it. There was a story in the news of how Kiwi artists&#39; artwork had been stolen and used to make cheap cushions. --&gt;&#xA;&lt;!-- According to Forbes in 2018, sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totalled $1.7 trillion per year. It is quite obvious that this theft is a big issue. However, on the other side of the coin, imitation is something innate to all of us. We follow the latest trends, dress to impress our co-workers and superiors --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are often told that &amp;ldquo;imitation is the best form of flattery&amp;rdquo; as a commandment to instead seek originality. However, our greatest works do not exist in a vacuum, they revisit and reinterpret existing ideas in subtle ways and inspire thought. Of course, counterfeits, piracy and copyright infringement are huge issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First published on Genesis Planetary on 24 Jun 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;This is a work of fiction.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Names, characters, businesses, places, events and incidents are either the products of the author’s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The city was filled endlessly with these streets. Wide-built, marked by a row of towering commercial buildings on each side, most of them dilapidated or on the verge of becoming heritage sites. The pavements were rough and filled with potholes, not that anyone noticed. The ground levels of the buildings often contained small stores, most of them in the business of convenience stores, selling basic necessities. But some stores were dark, filled with rough, dark and questionable people. I didn’t want to find out what they sold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
