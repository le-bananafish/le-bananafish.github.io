<h1 id="a-brief-enquiry-into-modern-society">A Brief Enquiry into Modern Society</h1>

<p>Last month, British band <strong>The 1975</strong> released the second single from their upcoming album &ldquo;<em>A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships</em>.&rdquo; Barring being a good song, the song also functions as a good criticism of society as the album title denotes. The best line in my subjective opinion is &ldquo;<em>Oh! F*** your feelings! / Truth is only hearsay!</em>&rdquo; which highlights a critical problem in modern society.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re so resistant to knowledge and information in an age full of information that we dismiss information that is potentially important as simply &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; without as much as a thought. On the reverse side, we are also so enthusiastic about gaining attention that we propagate information from untrustworthy news sources and promote them whenever they help our argument.</p>

<p>This post may seem like a general overblown social critique but there is a point here that I want to target and that is <strong><em>fast fashion</em></strong>. Those who know me will know that I am not particularly fashion savvy, I could tell you whether something is in trend but I wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about how to put them together.</p>

<p>This semester, I am taking PSYCH 108, an introductory psychology course and we recently watched a documentary called &ldquo;<em>The True Cost</em>&rdquo; and in it, the director introduces us to the dark side of our desire for fast expendable fashion. Of course, those who bother to read their clothes tags will be aware that their clothes are made in a developing country like Bangladesh or a country like China with a &ldquo;floating population&rdquo; (Wikipedia, 2018).</p>

<p>However, we are usually not consciously aware of the conditions of workers in those countries. We may hear about them periodically in the news and events like the Rana Plaza collapse may trend in the news for weeks but eventually we become only implicitly aware of them.</p>
