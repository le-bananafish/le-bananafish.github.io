<h1 id="a-brief-enquiry-into-modern-society">A Brief Enquiry into Modern Society</h1>

<p>Last month, British band <strong>The 1975</strong> released the second single from their upcoming album &ldquo;<em>A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships</em>.&rdquo; Barring being a good song, the song also functions as a good criticism of society as the album title denotes. The best line in my subjective opinion is &ldquo;<em>Oh! F*** your feelings! / Truth is only hearsay!</em>&rdquo; which highlights a critical problem in modern society.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re so resistant to knowledge and information in an age full of information that we dismiss information that is potentially important as simply &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; without as much as a thought. On the reverse side, we are also so enthusiastic about gaining attention that we propagate information from untrustworthy news sources and promote them whenever they help our argument.</p>

<p>This post may seem like an overblown social critique and it is. I recently watched the documentary &ldquo;<em>The True Cost</em>&rdquo; by Andrew Morgan. Whilst the contents of the documentary warrant a post on its own (that I won&rsquo;t make), the important part is our reaction to documentaries and reports on the ethical abuses prevalent in industry and manufacturing.</p>

<p>Because I watched it as part of a stage 1 psychology course, I will try to analyse this in psychological terms. Talking with friends, the most common response I could find was that they were going to continue to buy clothes from companies like H&amp;M. Why?</p>

<p>Even though there is a <em>social desirability</em> to supporting ethical behaviours, we are subject to a <em>normative social influence</em> that overrides our social desirability bias unless the cost of interaction is minimal e.g. the Better Cotton Initiative branding on Cotton On clothes. In this example which is characteristic of many clothing brands, we do not need to exercise any more effort than buying non-ethical clothing and so we do not object to it.</p>

<p>Whilst we are bombarded with ethical messaging everyday and thus implicitly aware of the terrible working conditions in factories in China, India and Bangladesh, we don&rsquo;t seem to have or express explicit awareness of these ethical abuses. Many probably heard about the Rana Plaza collapse in the news in 2013 but when we stroll in the shopping mall and pick out clothes, the event is never brought to mind.</p>

<p>You might wonder how I went from <em>The 1975</em> to <em>The True Cost</em> and what the point of this post has been. The point has been to highlight our avoidance of the harsh realities and consequences of our behaviour and the stress the need to accept the realities then find solutions that benefit not just ourselves the customers but also benefit the producers working in the factories.</p>
