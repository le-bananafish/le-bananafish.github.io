        <p>In the middle of January 2021 with nothing else to do, I made myself a New Years resolution. I vowed to write &ldquo;<strong>once a week, or at the bare minimum, once a month</strong>&rdquo;. I had a good run for three weeks in which I wrote a post roughly once a week. Then February hit, I procrastinated even more and the realisation that uni was looming sapped my willpower. So I amended my resolution to &ldquo;once a fortnight&rdquo; and wrote a single post in the entire month of February.</p>
<p>I am only sitting here writing this post because I have procrastinated most of March already (<em>jeez, we&rsquo;re already in the middle!!</em>) and because I feel like s* for doing so. Now some may blame university and the workload for their lack of progress but I procrastinated the first week of uni when we were in Level 3 lockdown and only managed to catch up for this second week. I&rsquo;m still one lecture behind in two courses.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t blame writer&rsquo;s block either. My mind is filled with ideas and potential outcomes for my projects; in fact some projects are &ldquo;finished&rdquo; in my head — I just haven&rsquo;t written any of it down. This is not new. When I was younger and although the worlds I created were essentially fan-fiction, I would imagine all their events, the emotional moments and the dramatic resolutions, and when I finished imagining it all — the story was over. Very little was committed to paper (or text) if at all.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have a clue how the New Horizons project is going to end, I am just confused whether it should go in the direction it is heading in. The eponymous novel <em>New Horizons</em> which is meant to be my first novel is not even being written. I have rewritten &ldquo;the first chapter&rdquo; (circa 100 words) over and over again trying to figure out how to start the novel and how to &ldquo;hook readers&rdquo; with it.</p>
<p>Movies are my medium of choice. Before COVID, we would go to the cinemas and watch the movie of the week, almost every week (it was $10, okay?) — so much so that we are VIP members of Events Cinemas &#x1f604;. So whenever I come up with ideas, I always envision them as scenes. I can see the characters&rsquo; actions, their overcompensations and their hesitations. I hear the noise, the rain, the footprints. However, I have no idea how to commit any of this text, most of all the action.</p>
<p><em>The hovercar descends on the vineyard, dust in the air. Curtains peel slightly in the nearby mansion. A row of apple trees line the driveway. It lands in the yard, a fountain in the centre.</em> But&hellip;</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been writing.</p>
<p>In fact, I started a new project over the holidays inspired by nostalgia (mentioned <a href="/posts/the-price-of-wisdom">here</a> and <a href="/posts/indecision-and-imitation">here</a>)&hellip; and I haven&rsquo;t even been writing for that project either! I&rsquo;ve consulted friends on my ideas, an amateur expert on a topic, and my dear old friend Wikipedia, but the writing hasn&rsquo;t really started.</p>
<p>The old and present me would be frustrated, disappointed, ashamed and disgusted with my lack of progress. I hope future me is better at this.</p>
<p>Anyways, as always, thanks for reading!</p>
<p><code>PS:</code> If I get it done, the next post may be the <em>first draft</em> of the first <del>story</del> chapter for my new project. <em>Maybe</em>&hellip;</p>
