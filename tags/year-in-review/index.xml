      <description>Twenty twenty-three will be the year I stop putting too much pressure on myself.&#xA;2023 is the year that I will do the things that I want to do in life.&#xA;Last year was a year of great change and paralysis. It was the year in which I finished my undergraduate degree(s) and the question of what I truly wanted to do in the future stared me straight in the face.</description>

      <description>Jan 17, 2021 Blah, blah, blah, 2020 was a terrible year. Done.&#xA;In the never-ending spirit tradition of setting a new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution that we don&amp;rsquo;t keep to, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d set a resolution given that we&amp;rsquo;re still in the opening days of the new year, i.e. it&amp;rsquo;s still January. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got time to start&amp;hellip;&#xA;I promise to write at least one post per fortnight, or at the bare minimum, once a month.</description>
