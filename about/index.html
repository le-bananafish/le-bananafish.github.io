<body><div class="wrap"><div class="section" id="content"><h1>About</h1><p><p>Hi, It&rsquo;s me. Who the hell is this <strong><em>me</em></strong> person being referred to?</p>

<p>My name is Sebastian Lau.</p>

<p>I am currently studying a conjoint degree in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Auckland.</p>

<!-- I write stories, intend to start a company and occasionally take decent photographs. -->

<p>I write stories, stream games and occassionally take decent photographs.</p>

<p>I am working on my worldbuilding project titled <em>New Horizons</em>. New Horizons is about the stories of individuals, their struggles and tribulations. It aims to capture the stories of life rather than stories as presented in television and film. See the <a href="/posts/new-horizons">announcement</a>.</p>

<p>My tentatively titled company <em>The Dreamers Club</em> is currently on-hold. This is because I both lack the expertise required for many of my aspirations and am uncertain about how to launch the company. See its <a href="#">mission</a>.</p>

<!-- My tentatively titled company _The Dreamers Club_ is currently on-hold. This is because I both lack the expertise required for many of my aspirations and am uncertain about how to launch the company. See its [mission](/posts/the-dreamers-club). -->

<!-- To any interested party, I have experience with a few programming languages acquired through various activities. C++ was my first language and acquired through a high school club and participation in informatics. Although Rust has been a long-time interest, it has often been neglected in lieu of C, Python and Java which I am required to use for university courses. -->

<p>I should mention Jekyll and Hugo, two static site frameworks which I have used for my personal website. Jekyll was used for a previous version of this site whereas Hugo is currently powering this website.</p>

<p>The purpose of this site is to share things that I consider personal and would normally not share, such as my stories, ideas, thoughts and hobbies as well as completely random things.</p>

<p>As I am normally reserved with my words, I will be more open and direct with the content on this site, and it will often be in a stream of consciousness. However, you may notice when my itchy editing finger has meddled with the content.</p>

<p>Thank you and hopefully I <!-- _see_ --> üëÅ you around my site.</p>

<p>Why change something that isn&rsquo;t broken? <em>Because I want to</em>, and things that <em>aren&rsquo;t broken</em> are <strong>boring</strong>.</p>
