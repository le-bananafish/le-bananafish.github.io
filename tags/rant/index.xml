First, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of reasons people give not to learn Māori:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a dead dying language It&amp;rsquo;s a dead dying culture (Some idea of superiority) You get the idea  Secondly, I would like to say I&amp;rsquo;m a linguist, or to be more exact, I&amp;rsquo;m studying linguistics.</description>
