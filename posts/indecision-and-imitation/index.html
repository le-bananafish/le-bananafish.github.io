<!-- I was going to tell you about my new project but decided it was better to talk about why I've taken a hiatus from so many of my projects. -->
<!-- It is said often that "imitation is the best form of flattery" however the full quote is "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness" (Oscar Wilde supposedly). We often use this quote as a criticism or negative remark when there really is no black and white morality here. -->
<!-- The largest problem with imitation is of course forgery, plagiarism and copyright infringement. By imitating, we are stealing the work of others and, even if not intentionally, pretend it is our own. And by and large, profiting from forgery, plagiarism and copyright infringement is a big industry that generates a lot of profit at the expense of its actual creators. -->
<!-- The largest problem with imitation is of course that some people pretend the work is their own and try to profit off of it. There was a story in the news of how Kiwi artists' artwork had been stolen and used to make cheap cushions. -->
<!-- According to Forbes in 2018, sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totalled $1.7 trillion per year. It is quite obvious that this theft is a big issue. However, on the other side of the coin, imitation is something innate to all of us. We follow the latest trends, dress to impress our co-workers and superiors -->
<p>We are often told that &ldquo;imitation is the best form of flattery&rdquo; as a commandment to instead seek originality. However, our greatest works do not exist in a vacuum, they revisit and reinterpret existing ideas in subtle ways and inspire thought. Of course, counterfeits, piracy and copyright infringement are huge issues.</p>
<p>Voltaire (once) said, &ldquo;<em>Ainsi, presque tout est imitation&hellip; Les esprits les plus originaux empruntent les uns des autres</em>,&rdquo; or artistically rendered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Originality is nothing but judicious imitation. The most original writers borrowed from one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, where is this going? Well, I was originally going into a deep dive of two of my projects and talk about how they turned or are turning into convoluted messes. However, in attempting to write that article, I got stumped, distracted and it itself became a convoluted mess.</p>
<p>Instead I will speak generally, though still about myself.</p>
<p>In the process of developing an idea or project, we look to others for influence and inspiration. Sometimes, the work of another may be a direct inspiration for what you are doing. If you are like me, you deep dive when you start researching your influences, going so far that the intricacies of your influence are so much more salient to you than the spark â€“ <em>your idea</em>.</p>
<p>New Horizons started out with a couple of goals, in this order: create a realistically-grounded presentation of magic, confront how human identity is shaped, and explore my creativity. The two biggest influences on the project were the <em>Blade Runner</em> film series and <em>Ghost in the Shell (2017)</em>. However, as I looked to other influences like Destiny 2, Borderlands 3, I began seeing how my ideas were paralleled in these works, and before I knew it, I was struggling to reconcile my conception of certain ideas with their depictions in those works.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 and the immense pool of free time last year, I delved into some topics that I had interest in but had never looked at, such as Warhammer 40K. This eventually inspired a future setting for New Horizons (set in the 2800s) that I never actually wanted. Similarly, when I started watching Altered Carbon season 2, that spawned another, alternate future that I didn&rsquo;t intend to.</p>
<p>And this brings us to an interesting point. Sarah on Zing Collaborative (no affiliation) writes, (<a href="https://www.zingcollaborative.com/blog-content/2017/5/18/imitation-is-not-flattery-and-what-to-do-instead">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And often, in order to <em>find</em> our truth, we need to take a little break from all the inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- I had flooded my project with influence and inspiration, but more importantly, I was looking at how _they_ were doing this and not how _I_ will do things. There is value in distinction and diversity; otherwise we will live in a bland world. -->
<p>I had flooded my project with influences and inspiration, but more importantly, I was copying how <em>they</em> had done things rather than focusing on how <em>I</em> would do things. There is value in distinction and diversity; in it&rsquo;s absence we would live in a bland world.</p>
<p>This leads us to my new project, and this is as close to an announcement for it as you will get for now. There&rsquo;s still a lot of things to settle and determine before I should reveal it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>As a combination of nostalgia, COVID-19, and money that I should&rsquo;ve saved, I fell back into the rabbit hole of trading card games. I finished my Infernity deck, am starting to play Magic, and <strong>am making my own card game</strong></em>.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- "See, in primary and intermediate, I played Yu-Gi-Oh and I discovered a deck that I thought was awesome. Its core mechanic was a gimmick &ndash; have no cards in your hand." -->
<p><code>Sidenote:</code> I was going to tell you the story of how this all unfolded but I got bored reading it. I&rsquo;ll tell you what it&rsquo;s about later.</p>
<p><del>When I was in primary, every two years there would be a Scholastic Book Fair. One year I bought a pack of Harry Potter themed playing cards. However, these cards were designed for performing magic tricks. Some had blank faces, some had half the correct face and half the face of another card, and others only had two card backs.</del></p>
<p><sup>The crossed-out text is just a taster of how much stuff I&rsquo;ve rewritten.</sup></p>
<p>=)</p>
<!-- I invented a card game in the vein of Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic using those cards, and as a result of my trip down memory lane, I was inspired to do so again. -->
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said, I&rsquo;ve rewritten this too many times, it&rsquo;s gotten too convoluted, and right now it&rsquo;s barely cohesive. But anyways, as always, thanks for reading!</p>
<!-- The archetype of the deck was called Infernity, and Infernity cards all had effects to the effect of "When you have no cards in your hand, [something]," which is a gimmick mechanic. Having no cards in your hand is a terrible situation. Your capacity to respond to threats rely purely on luck and in general, just have less cards to respond with. -->
<!-- But I was never one to follow the meta and so I pursued building the deck as much as I could as a jobless child. When I stopped playing, I had some of the key cards but the more powerful ones were out of my reach. -->
<!-- Cut to modern day and with COVID-19, I was left with money that I otherwise would've eaten. By chance encounter when my sister went to get her tragus pierced, I discovered a brand new hobby store. I went home and researched the deck I tried to build and discovered that they released new support cards for it. Amazing how much the internet and a debit card helps as well. -->
<!-- The second nostalgia component comes from a Harry Potter themed deck of playing cards designed for performing magic tricks. I was never interested in magic tricks but for some reason bought that deck to have parity with my friend. Many of the cards had abnormal faces &ndash; some were blank, some had half the correct face and half the face of another card, and others only had two card backs. For some reason, I decided to turn this into a card game in the vein of Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon and Magic: the Gathering. -->
<!-- "And there was a particular type of deck that ~~I fell in love with~~ inspired me. It wasn't the best deck to any extent, the core mechanic was more of a gimmick." -->
<!-- With COVID-19 and the immense pool of free time last year, I began delving into topics I had some interest in but had never looked in. The most important example of this was Warhammer 40K. Before I knew it, New Horizons had gained a future timeline whose general structure was inspired by Warhammer 40K. I invented a character with a ridiculous name, Junivus Januarius, who would serve a similar role to the God-Emperor of Mankind from 40K. He would rule a crumbling human empire and engineered a political crisis with the Confederacy of Planets, an important faction within the New Horizons universe, in order to mobilise humanity to aggressively colonize new planets and demonstrate our superiority. -->
<!-- However, this was such a giant diversion from the main premise of the project and no sooner than I had started it had I frozen it. At a similar time, I started watching Altered Carbon, specifically season 2, and the premise of the season inspired me. Takeshi Kovacs, the main character, is offered a protection job, and when his assignment ends up murdered, finds himself involved in a political conspiracy. A storyline based on this idea then replaced the Warhammer 40K one. I froze this one as well. -->
<!-- So, where is this going? Well, we are going into a deep-dive into some of my projects and why I am struggling. -->
<!-- ## Revisiting New Horizons -->
<!-- New Horizons is a worldbuilding project. It takes inspiration from numerous sources but what forms its core is the _Blade Runner_ and _Ghost in the Shell_ series. This then took inspiration from the turmoil of the 2017-2018 North Korea Crisis as well as other political events that fell into the wayside (2014 Crimean Crisis). Interesting how we forget these things, eh? -->
<!-- First however, New Horizons evolved from a project that wanted to present magic in more grounded and realistic ways than Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. It didn't want to turn magic into a pseudo-science with carefully brewed potions and expertly calculated spells, but rather underpin its possibilities with the natural physical world. I'll let you decide how that turned out. -->
<!-- At the core of _Blade Runner_ and _Ghost in the Shell_ are questions of identity, what it means to be a human, and culture. Blade Runner uses the replicants as a vehicle for this, whereas Ghost in the Shell uses cyborgs and prosthetic augmentations. -->
<!-- The replicants (Nexus 6) of the first film have a built-in expiration date of four years and are prohibited from coming to Earth. Thus, the central premise of the first film concerns the illegal arrival of six replicants to Earth in search of more life. Throughout the film, we are shown the differences between human and replicant interactions. The humans of this post-apocalyptic Earth are cold and indifferent in stark contrast to the replicants who are more emotional and empathetic with one another. The irony lies in the fact that the test between humans and replicants, the Voigt-Kampff Test, is a measure of emotional response, and is meant to imply that only humans are capable of it. -->
<!-- The replicants (Nexus 9) of the second film have an open-ended lifetime but are designed to "obey"; in one of the short films to promote the film, Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) instructs one of his brand new Nexus 9 androids to choose: kill him or kill itself. It complies. This film continues the theme of the first but makes these relations more overt. Throughout the film K, our main character who is a replicant, is treated with disgust, even within the police station where he works. The only humans who treat him like a person, treat him only with indifference. -->
<!-- In Ghost in the Shell, Maj. Motoko Kusanagi is a cyborg agent of the Japanese government working for the para-militaristic Public Security Section 9. Their role is essentially counter-terrorism... -->
<!-- Replicants are "bio-engineered humans" (_BR2049_) designed for use as menial work and for the undesired industries of war and prostitution. Between the events of the first and second movies, a human supremacy movement rises up against the Replicants and uses the public database to track down and exterminate replicants. In retaliation, a small group of replicants hatch a plan to denote a nuclear weapon above Los Angeles, using it as an EMP to disrupt digital systems, and then destroy the servers that host the database. This all results in replicants being banned until just before the events of the second film. -->
